#+title: Web analytics from CloudFront access logs with GoAccess

#+description: Set up GoAccess to parse CloudFront access logs and generate web analytics for static sites hosted on AWS

First, turn on [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesLoggingOnOff][turn on logging]] in your CloudFront Distribution settings to get logs written to an S3 bucket. 
Then, use the [[https://aws.amazon.com/cli/][AWS command line interface]][fn:aws-install] to sync the logs to a local directory:[fn:filtering]

#+caption: =sync.sh=
#+begin_src shell :tangle sync.sh :shebang #!/bin/sh :eval no
  aws s3 sync s3://jeffkreeftmeijer.com-log-cf logs
#+end_src

With the logs downloaded, generate a report by passing the logs to [[https://goaccess.io][GoAccess]] to produce a 28-day HTML[fn:formats] report:

#+caption: =html.sh=
#+header: :tangle html.sh
#+header: :shebang #!/bin/sh
#+header: :eval no
#+header: :prologue cd ~/stats
#+begin_src shell
  find logs -name "*.gz" | \
      xargs gzcat | \
      grep --invert-match --file=exclude.txt | \
      /usr/local/bin/goaccess \
	  --log-format "%d\\t%t\\t%^\\t%b\\t%h\\t%m\\t%^\\t%r\\t%s\\t%R\\t%u\\t%^" \
	  --date-format CLOUDFRONT \
	  --time-format CLOUDFRONT \
	  --ignore-crawlers \
	  --ignore-status=301 \
	  --ignore-status=302 \
	  --keep-last=28 \
	  --output index.html
#+end_src

This command consists of four commands piped together:

- =find logs -name "*.gz"= ::
  Produce a list of all files in the =logs= directory.
  Because of the number of files in the logs directory, passing a directory glob to =gunzip= directly would result in an "argument list too long" error because the list of filenames exceeds the =ARG_MAX= configuration:

  #+begin_src shell :exports both :results output :prologue "exec 2>&1" :epilogue ":" :cache yes
    gunzip logs/*.gz
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS[96e138d4133a04407bd6ac7ed093f4181154b72c]:
  : zsh: argument list too long: gunzip

- =xargs gzcat= ::

  =xargs= takes the output from =find=---which outputs a stream of filenames delimited by newlines---and calls the =gzcat= utility for every line by appending it to the passed command.
  Essentially, this runs the =gzcat= command for every file in the =logs= directory.

  =gzcat= is an alias for =gzip --decompress --stdout=, which decompresses gzipped files and prints the output to the standard output stream.

- =grep --invert-match --file=exclude.txt= ::

  =grep= takes the input stream and filters out all log lines that match a line in the exclude file (=exclude.txt=).
  The exclude file is a list of words that are ignored when producing the report[fn:exclude].

- =goaccess â€¦= ::

  The decompressed logs get piped to =goaccess= to generate a report with the following options:

  - =--log-format "%d\\t%t\\t%^\\t%b\\t%h\\t%m\\t%^\\t%r\\t%s\\t%R\\t%u\\t%^"= ::
    Use CloudFront's log format.[fn:log-format]

  - =--log-format CLOUDFRONT --date-format CLOUDFRONT --time-format CLOUDFRONT= ::
    Use CloudFront's date and time formats to parse the log lines.

  - =--ignore-crawlers --ignore-status=301 --ignore-status=302= ::
    Ignore crawlers and redirects.

  - =--keep-last=28= ::
    Use the last 28 days to build the report.

  - =--output=index.html= ::
    Output an HTML report to a file named =index.html=.

To sync the logs and generate a new report, run the =sync.sh= and =html.sh= scripts in a cron job every night at midnight:

#+begin_src shell
  echo '0 0 * * * ~/stats/sync.sh && ~/stats/html.sh' | crontab
#+end_src

[fn:aws-install] On a mac, use Homebrew:

#+begin_src shell :eval no
  brew install awscli
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[fn:filtering] Running the =aws s3 sync= command on an empty local directory took me two hours and produced a 2.1 GB directory of =.gz= files for roughly 3 years of logs.
Updating the logs by running the same command takes about five minutes.

Since I'm only interested in the stats for the last 28 days, it would make sense to only download the last 28 days of logs to generate the report.
However, AWS's command line tool doesn't support filters like that.

One thing that does work is using both the =--exclude= and =--include= options to include only the logs for the current month:

#+begin_src shell  :eval no
  aws s3 sync --exclude "*" --include "*2021-07-*" s3://jeffkreeftmeijer.com-log-cf ~/stats/logs
#+end_src

While this still loops over all files, it won't download anything outside of the selected month.

The command accepts the =--include== option multiple times, so it's possible to select multiple months like this.
One could, theoretically, write a script that finds the current year and month, then downloads that stats matching that month and the month before it to produce a 28-day report.

[fn:formats] GoAccess generates JSON and CSV files when passing a filename with a =.json= or =.csv= extension, respectively.
To generate the 28-day report in CSV format:

#+caption: =csv.sh=
#+header: :tangle csv.sh
#+header: :shebang #!/bin/sh
#+header: :eval no
#+header: :prologue cd ~/stats
#+begin_src shell
  find logs -name "*.gz" | \
      xargs gzcat | \
      grep --invert-match --file=exclude.txt | \
      /usr/local/bin/goaccess \
	  --log-format "%d\\t%t\\t%^\\t%b\\t%h\\t%m\\t%^\\t%r\\t%s\\t%R\\t%u\\t%^" \
	  --date-format CLOUDFRONT \
	  --time-format CLOUDFRONT \
	  --ignore-crawlers \
	  --ignore-status=301 \
	  --ignore-status=302 \
	  --keep-last=28 \
	  --output stats.csv
#+end_src

[fn:exclude] My =exclude.txt= currently consists of the =HEAD= HTTP request type and the path to the feed file:

#+header: :tangle exclude.txt
#+begin_example
  HEAD
  feed.xml
#+end_example

[fn:log-format] Initially, the value for the =--log-format= option was ~CLOUDFRONT~, which points to a [[https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess/blob/d31d37619691abc75cd5e0d54f57b010ace1a58f/src/settings.c#L74][predefined log format]].
However, [[https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess/commit/c7d3506157368c5d35c5869cee59701c45d67854][that internal value changed]], which broke the script when updating goaccess, producing errors like this:

#+begin_example

==77953== Format Errors - Verify your log/date/time format
#+end_example

I haven't been able to find out what the problem is, so I've reverted to the old log format for the time being.
I'm suspecting the newly introduced log format in GoAccess doesn't match the old log lines from 2017 anymore.

An example of a log line that doesn't match the new log format:
